# Sparse Representation based Classification

The idea of incorporating CS for classification purposes was developed in 2009
for the first time in face recognition application. In this study, Wright et al.
mapped the classification problem into a CS problem using the basic equation y= Ax
and called it Sparse Representation-based Classification (SRC). They also reported
interesting results on face recognition application which were outstanding in both
recognition rates and robustness to noise when compared to other face recognition
methods. Since then, SRC was used in different applications and moreover, lots of
supplement algorithms were developed and published on top of the original SRC
method. This code implements SRC from scratch using Lasso as sparse signal generator. And implement on 5 datasets of UCI.
